intro: Panic Button is an SMS alert application for Android that enables human rights defenders and other individuals at risk to get out a message and location information as fast as possible to their network in an emergency.

> We think Panic Button is a tool that can be useful in countries like Sudan where mass arrests and detention of human rights defenders are common and where often families of the victims struggle to know the whereabouts of their loved one. <footer><cite>Participants from the East and Horn of Africa Human Rights Defenders network</cite></footer>

## The Story behind Panic Button

Amnesty developed Panic Button with the aim of turning an activist's mobile phone into a secret alarm that can help them to get help fast in an emergency. The app encourages peer-to-peer security planning and response.

Panic Button was the product of an [open design process that we kicked off with OpenIDEO](http://www.openideo.com/challenge/amnesty/brief.html) in early 2012. Since its inception, dozens of activists, volunteer designers, programmers and security experts have helped to develop the concept helping Amnesty to build the first version of the app.

## The organisations supporting Panic Button

The Panic Button project is an initiative of Amnesty International in collaboration with key advisors and partners including [Front Line Defenders](http://www.frontlinedefenders.org/), iilab and [the engine room](https://www.theengineroom.org/).

Panic Button also belongs to a wider community of advisors and friends. Special thanks go to the network of human rights activists from more than ten countries who have worked with us over the months to collaboratively design the app and have given many hours feeding back on the usability and functionality of the app.

A huge thanks is also owed to the many programmers and designers who have donated their time and skills to develop the app over the past two years. We are especially grateful to the OpenIDEO community for kick-starting the project and to [ThoughtWorks](http://www.thoughtworks.com/) who generously helped to develop the first working prototype of the app.

Panic Button was supported with seed funding from the [Ford Foundation](http://www.fordfoundation.org/) and was awarded a further Â£100,000 to build on and pilot the app thanks to the [Google Global Impact Challenge](http://livewire.amnesty.org/2013/05/22/a-lifeline-for-activists/).
