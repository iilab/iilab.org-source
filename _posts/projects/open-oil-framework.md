> OpenOil believes that oil and gas production can benefit the citizens of producing countries more effectively, and the damage wrought by opaque and undemocratic government, often as a result of the prize to be obtained by controlling natural resource wealth, can be mitigated and reversed

## Mapping Corporate Networks

OpenOil is developing a network of corporate relations in the oil, gas and mining industries. iilab is developing a tool that can be used to facilitate investigations into the major corporate players in the extractive industries of certain countries including Nigeria, Tunisia and Mozambique. 

The public domain data we plan to surface in this application will help people understand issues like:
 - Which companies own which other companies â€“ who is in the corporate 'family tree'
 - Which companies hold the contracts for major concession areas, including both primary primary production contracts and secondary subcontracts to service companies
 - Who is behind these companies, i.e. members of the board, executive officers, managers etc.
 - What government agencies and officials are involved in industry oversight in areas like license
allocation, project approval or dispute resolution
