## What is the Open Integrity Index? 

The Open Integrity Index enables users to make sophisticated decisions about the tools they use for privacy and communications, without requiring a high-level security engineering background.

OII has several distinct objectives, including:
 - Enabling users to make educated decisions about the tools they use and the ways in which they expose their personal information.
 - Establishing a platform for the results of independent audits to be made accessible to a general audience.
 - Providing a resource for other platforms, such as application markets, to integrate digital security into the decision-making process of installing software.
 - Improving access to material on digital security principles in languages other than English.
 - Promoting stronger awareness on fundamental precepts of privacy by design in the development of communications tools.
 - Encouraging stronger relationships between developers and their communities of users.
